# RaytracerJava

This is the first real picture I got out of my raytracer:

<img src="images/raytracer.png" width="50%">

Then I added shadows, so the whole scene got a lot darker:

<img src="images/raytracerShadow.png" width="50%">

So I also added a lightblue background and an extra light:

<img src="images/twoWhiteLights.png" width="50%">

Next step is to implement different materials, such as glass for example.
